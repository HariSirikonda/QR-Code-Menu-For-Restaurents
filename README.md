# QR Code Menu Generator

QR Code Menu Generator is a web application designed to help restaurant owners create QR codes for their menu cards. By providing the restaurant name and a Google Drive link to a PDF of the menu, the application generates a downloadable QR code image. This QR code can be printed and placed on tables, enabling customers to easily scan and access the restaurant menu.
